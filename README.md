### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mingchao Zhang. I'm just a PHP Developer, engaged in the development of B2B related applications in traditional industries. And now I'm working at [![](https://www.bankcement.com/favicon.ico)](https://www.bankcement.com/), which is a B2B company in the cement industry, as PHP Developer building APIs for Mobile APP and OMS by using Laravel/Lumen.

I'm very like Laravel and Vue.js. Recently, I'm learning Nuxt.js. [Cootab.com](https://cootab.com/) and [YouLinkin.com](https://youlinkin.com/) are mines made using Laravel and Nuxt.js.
