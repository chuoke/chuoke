### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a PHP Developer, engaged in the development of B2B related applications in traditional industries. As PHP Developer building APIs for Mobile APP and ABIS by using Laravel.

I'm very like Laravel and Vue.js. [Cootab](https://cootab.com/) and [YouLinkin](https://youlinkin.com/) are mines made using Laravel and Nuxt.js.
